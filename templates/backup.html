            <p id="main_text">
                Am I Cancelled? is a Twitter App that searches through a large bank of words that may have been socially acceptable<br> years ago, but no longer have a place in today's society. It goes through your entire Twitter account history searching for<br> these terms in the word bank.
                <br>

            <h2>Why Did I Make This?</h2>
            <p id="main_text">
                Am I Cancelled? is a Twitter App that is meant to help those who have forgotten about old tweets <br> they have made in the past that no longer accurately reflect their beliefs anymore. <br> I can only hope that this is used by those who have genuinely changed from their past selves.
                <br>

            <h2>Have Word Suggestions?</h2>
            <p id="main_text">
                If you wish to know the list of words used or have any words that may not be included in the search,<br>please email me using the email link in the footer of this page.
